# BountyBot

Automated bug bounty payout approval agent powered by the [Open Wallet Standard (OWS)](https://openwallet.sh).

Submit a bug report → agent evaluates quality & severity → payout approval is signed automatically. Private keys never leave the OWS vault.

## How It Works

```
📝 Bug Report → 🧠 Evaluate → 🔒 Policy Check → ✍️ Sign Approval → 📦 Relay / Broadcast
```

1. Researcher submits a bug report with severity, description, and wallet address
2. Evaluator scores the report based on quality signals (reproduction steps, impact analysis, PoC, etc.)
3. The app checks per-bug and daily spending limits before any signing occurs, while OWS policies gate chain access
4. If approved, a payout authorization is signed inside the OWS vault — the private key is never exposed
5. A downstream relayer can broadcast the real payout transaction

## Features

- **Quality scoring** — Reports are scored 0–10 based on technical signals (PoC, reproduction steps, impact, vulnerability class)
- **Duplicate detection** — Prevents double payouts for the same finding, even after a restart
- **Persistent state** — Reports, payout approvals, counters, and duplicate history survive process restarts
- **Policy enforcement** — App-level per-bug and daily spending limits with an explicit EVM/Solana signing allowlist
- **Multi-chain wallets** — Single treasury with addresses for EVM, Solana, Bitcoin, Cosmos, and more
- **Real-time dashboard** — Live SSE feed showing submissions, evaluations, and payout approvals
- **Demo mode** — One-click buttons to fill high-quality and low-quality sample reports

## API

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|

### Submit a report

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/report/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "SQL Injection in /api/users",
    "severity": "critical",
    "description": "Steps to reproduce: inject payload. Impact: full DB access. PoC included.",
    "reporterWallet": "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f2bD38"
  }'
```

## OWS Integration

BountyBot uses three core OWS primitives:

- **`createWallet`** — Multi-chain treasury wallet (EVM, Solana, Bitcoin, Cosmos, Tron, TON, Sui, Filecoin)
- **`createPolicy`** — Chain allowlists enforced before signing
- **`signMessage`** — Cryptographic signing inside the vault; private key is decrypted in hardened memory and wiped after use

The demo currently signs payout approvals, not raw transactions. A live deployment would hand the approval to a relayer or switch to `signAndSend` with chain-specific transaction construction.

For the current SDK flow, the server mirrors the chain allowlist in request validation and only accepts `evm` and `solana` payout chains.

Recipient addresses are also validated against the selected payout chain before any signing occurs.

The agent can approve and sign payouts but **cannot**:
- Exceed per-transaction or daily spending limits
- Sign on unauthorized chains
- Access the raw private key

## Severity Payouts

| Severity | Range |
|----------|-------|
| Critical | $80 – $150 |
| High | $40 – $80 |
| Medium | $15 – $40 |
| Low | $5 – $15 |

Final payout scales with report quality score (0–10).
